# week8-testing-yassien-abdullah

Task: build a to-do list tracker that allow users to create, complete and delete tasks from a list.

## User Stories

### Core user stories

As a busy person, I want to:

- [x] Add tasks to a list so that I can keep track of them
- [x] Check things off my list so that I can see what I’ve done 
- [x] Delete things from the list if I don’t need to do them anymore

As a motor-impaired user, I want to:

- [x] Use all the features of the app without a mouse

### Stretch user stories

As a busy person, I want to:

- [x] Filter out completed to-dos from my list so that I can focus on what’s left to do

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] A working to-do list
- [x] Tests for (at least) each user story
- [x] A responsive, mobile-first design
- [ ] Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible
